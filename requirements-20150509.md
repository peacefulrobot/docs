*Rough Draft*

PEACEFUL ROBOT REQUIREMENTS FOR 20150509
Version 0.0.1-alpha


PURPOSE AND SCOPE, BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVES

Peaceful Robot is a not-for-profit cybersecurity
service that provides the analysis of source code,
applications and systems for security weaknesses.
Service source code is open source. Expected funding
will be via hosted service, bug bounty programs and
micro-donations.

Services provided by Peaceful Robot would include
manual and automated analysis of source code,
applications and systems for security weaknesses. These
services will use novel, innovative ways in the form of
reusable, loose-coupled modules that are available on
the Internet.

Source code and documentation will use licenses that
use the share-alike model. Source code uses the GNU
Affero General Public License (AGPL) license.
Documentation uses the Creative Commons BY-ShareAlike
(CC-BY-SA) license. Using licenses in the share-alike
model, with provisions for hosted versions will help
keep the source code and documentation transparent and
open.
