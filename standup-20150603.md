STAND UP 20150603 MINUTES FOR ITERATION 20150624 (#3)


1. Selected time-based bug bounty target and started
setting up environment to start finding
vulnerabilities. Selected the Integrity domain for
the target's scope.
2. Process the testing environment further.
3. Realizing that building clean environments for bug
hunting is a lot of overhead. Build docker box with
git, 3-tier web infrastructure and security testing
tools so I can save 3 hours on setting the
infrastructure up.
